1. ID regions that are green (and not blue). Ignore red. 
2. Pull DNA
3. Run Homer.
4. ID top TFBS
5. Remove TFBS that aren't expressed (based on RNA-seq)
6. Find closest 1-4 genes (or within 1mb) for each peak, split by TFBS type
7. Classify each gene by promoter open/close and expression (off/med/high?)
8. GO Term / pathway enrichment of gene sets

1. Global Homer(?) or fimo for enriched TFBS or HOCOMOCO

1. Pattern each gene (GFP peaks, differential expression, peak promoter) and classify
